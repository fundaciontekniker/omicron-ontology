To ensure the final quality of an ontology, this must be carefully designed and implemented. Therefore, the use of well-founded ontology development methodologies is advised. After reviewing different methodologies, the OMICRON ontology developers decided to follow the LOT (Linked Open Terms) Methodology (https://lot.linkeddata.es/). LOT is an industrial method for developing ontologies and vocabularies, and it has been used in other H2020 funded projects such as REACT, AI-PROFICIENT or ONTOCOMMONS. It can be considered an evolution of the NeOn methodology, as it lightens it with sprints iterations (from the scrum software development framework) and covers the ontology publication following the best practices.
Following LOT guidelines, based on 22 Competency Questions that the ontology should solve (defined considering the requirements of 6 representative use cases) the relevant terms for the ontology where defined and before the implementation phase, existing standards were identified and selected for reuse. The reused ontologies for OMICRON development are the following ones:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-schema-specifications/">IFC_4x3</a>, for the road infrastructural aspects.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/iofoundry/Core">IOF-Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology/tree/master/maintenance">IOF-Maintenance</a>, for inspection and maintenance activities. </li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/InformationModel">IDSA</a> for data resources aspects.</li>
</ul>

The following figure shows an excerpt of the ontology with the main classes and relations.
